//There is another Logic folder in OpenDentBusiness that is for certain kinds of logic that does not need access to OpenDental classes.
//The classes in this folder should not make any calls to the Db.
//They can access other OpenDental classes.
//They can have UI elements in them, such as MessageBoxes.
//They can help encapsulate processing that doesn't really involve the form.
